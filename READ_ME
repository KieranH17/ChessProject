# TODO
change empty board pieces to be "" rather than del
- involves changing setpieces and making moves
- or instead of indexing board_dict (i.e. board_dict[key]) use (board_dict.get(key)) which returns None not KeyError

Have buffer board spaces to speed up moves (for AI only make moves linear - 64x - not tuple)

Fix the super function for the pieces
think of a way to make fake moves - or maybe have a fake game
